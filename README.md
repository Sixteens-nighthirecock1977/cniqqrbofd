Oh man, just finished watching The Accountant 2. You know what, Ben Affleck still has that thing, like mysterious but super intense, ya know? It’s like you think he’s just any guy with a pocket protector but then BAM! He’s out there doing all those crazy stunts like it’s just another Tuesday. Makes me feel like I need a cooler day job or something. 😂

Seriously though, they brought some wild twists in this one. I was like, wait what? That’s what’s happening now?? And the action scenes, phew, got me all hyped up and wired. It's kinda funny, though, cause sometimes it feels like they’re just making it up as they go along. But who cares, right?

> And Anna Kendrick! I mean, she pops up and it feels like a completely different movie for a second. Don’t get me wrong, she’s awesome as always, but it was like adding a sprinkle of comedy on a very serious sandwich, if that makes any sense. 😆

Did I mention how I had to download the movie because everyone was talking about it? Like, had to see what’s up myself. No regrets there. Anyway, the cinematography or whatever is top-notch, pretty much expected but still worth a mention. Do you get that same vibe that they play up those analytical problem-solving like it’s some superhero power? Satisfying to watch, though, not gonna lie.

I kinda lost my train of thought there for sec. Oh, and there’s that scene where they’re breaking down the numbers and all, kinda reminds me when you try to decode these new sales targets. 😂 You gotta watch the movie, I swear it feels like 90% adrenaline, 10% brain gymnastics.

> But yeah, overthinking it, I guess. Sometimes it feels like these scripts are churning out more code-like dialogue than real words. Speaking of, I don’t even know why this came up but like, “int main() { return 0; }” or something like?? Maybe my brain’s just wired that way today. 😂

Really though, overall pretty solid for a sequel. Lemme know if you catch it soon, curious if I was just in a funky mood or if it really was all that!
